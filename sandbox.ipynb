and\\n\\n    (3) has represented nearly 1,300 pregnancy centers that currently \\noperate as medical clinics;\\n\\nWhereas more than 53,000 people in the United States volunteer at community-\\n        supported pregnancy centers each year, including more than 5,000 \\n        licensed medical professionals;\\nWhereas nearly 2,250 medical pregnancy centers provide a limited ultrasound at \\n        little or no cost to women;\\nWhereas, in 2019, more than 486,000 ultrasounds were performed at medical \\n        pregnancy centers;\\nWhereas pregnancy centers understand that pregnancy can be emotional for mothers \\n        and fathers, and the compassionate staff and trained volunteers of \\n        pregnancy centers--\\n\\n    (1) provide each patient with educational materials; and\\n\\n    (2) offer each patient emotional support and care to help each patient \\nthrough difficult situations;\\n\\nWhereas close to 88 percent of pregnancy centers in the United States offer \\n        specialized parenting education--\\n\\n    (1) through direct services on premises;

or\\n\\n    (4) nutritional counseling and resources;\\n\\nWhereas pregnancy centers--\\n\\n    (1) do not discriminate based on age, race, nationality, creed, \\nreligious affiliation, disability, or arbitrary circumstances; and\\n\\n    (2) take special care to provide help to underserved minority \\npopulations;\\n\\nWhereas pregnancy centers have committed to engaging fathers so that they can \\n        acquire the skills necessary to become involved and responsible fathers;\\nWhereas Care Net-affiliated pregnancy centers have saved more than 886,000 \\n        babies since 2008;\\nWhereas Heartbeat International reports that the Abortion Pill Rescue Network \\n        has saved more than 5,000 lives from in-process chemical abortions since \\n        2012;\\nWhereas, between 2010 and 2024, 8 of 10 women considering abortion when they \\n        entered a Care Net-affiliated pregnancy care and resource center ended \\n        up choosing life;\\nWhereas, in 2022 alone, pregnancy centers--\\n\\n    (1) provided 546,000 free ultrasound scans;\\n\\n    (2) provided parenting support and education to nearly 410,000 \\nindividuals;\\n\\n    (3) provided more than 9,450,000 of free material resources to \\nindividuals in need;

and\\n\\n    G    (F) operation standards;\\n\\nWhereas less than 10 percent of the income of pregnancy centers in the United \\n        States is derived from governmental sources, which ensures that \\n        pregnancy centers--\\n\\n    (1) minimize burdens on each taxpayer; and\\n\\n    (2) engage local communities to provide sustainable support; and\\n\\nWhereas, after the reversal of Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), pregnancy \\n        centers have wrongfully been the subject of vandalism and violence: Now, \\n        therefore, be it\\n    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\\n            (1) expresses support for the recognition of ``National \\n        Pregnancy Center Week'';\\n            (2) supports the important work of pregnancy centers across \\n        the United States;\\n            (3) appreciates and recognizes the thousands of volunteers \\n        and staff of pregnancy centers in the United States who give \\n        millions of hours of service each year to women and men who are \\n        faced with difficult pregnancy decisions; and\\n            (4) recognizes the importance of--\\n                    (A) protecting life; and\\n                    (B) assisting women and men in need as they bring \\n                children into the world.\\n                                 <all>\\n\\n\"}"
